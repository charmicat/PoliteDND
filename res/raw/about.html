<br>
<br>Polite DND (PDND for short) is a Do Not Disturb application
with a twist: instead of just silencing your phone or sending an SMS
with apologies, it disables the cellphone&#39;s ability to receive
phone calls altogether by enabling Airplane Mode. Sometimes you just
want to be unavailable, not bothering to explain why you&#39;re not
taking calls, while still using your phone. It&#39;s easier to explain
that you&#39;re having &quot;technical difficulties&quot; than telling
your contacts you don&#39;t want to talk to them.
<br />
<br /> Features:
<br>- Schedule when the app runs, much like an alarm clock: define
when to start and stop the app, for which days of the week it will be
active and it&#39;ll do its magic.
<br> - Run-once schedules: you can create a &quot;one-shot&quot;
schedule that will run once, on the day you create it.
<br> - Manual Stop: you can create schedules that run indefinitely, until manually stopped.
